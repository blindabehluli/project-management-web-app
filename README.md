Project Management

This is a fullstack web app that allows teams to manage their projects and tasks collaboratively. Users can create workspaces and invite other team members to join. Within each workspace, users can create boards, each containing multiple columns that represent the stages of a project or task. Users can then create tasks and subtasks, which can be assigned to specific team members and moved between columns to track progress. The app also allows users to customize their board with background images, labels for each card etc. User roles, including admin, editor, and viewer, provide flexible access control.
