### Project Management Web App

This repository contains a REST API built using the Express framework, Sequelize ORM and SQLite database, which serves as the backend for a project management web application.

The API endpoints are designed to handle various CRUD operations on project and task data, and can be easily integrated with a front-end application. The use of Sequelize ORM provides a flexible and intuitive approach to handling database queries and management. Additionally, the use of SQLite offers a lightweight and scalable solution for storing and retrieving data. This API has been developed with a focus on scalability, performance, and maintainability, and can serve as a solid foundation for building robust project management applications.
